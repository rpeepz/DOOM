DOOM Map Maker notes

02-04-20
Today I studdied the code and the workings of the Nuklear demo:
	Calculator

The Calculator code was very simple, straight forward, and easy to follow
how the nuklear api was implemented. Its function was to make a pannel with
buttons and a display that performed simple math on floating point numbers.

I replicated some of the flags used to make my own pannel that displayed
items in an array.
I also made a slider that modified an arbitrary value that was displayed in
the pannel.

Messed around with making lines using the map maker pannel.
