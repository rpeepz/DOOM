DOOM Map Maker notes

02-04-20
Today I studdied the code and the workings of the Nuklear demo:
	Calculator

The Calculator code was very simple, straight forward, and easy to follow
how the nuklear api was implemented. Its function was to make a pannel with
buttons and a display that performed simple math on floating point numbers.

I replicated some of the flags used to make my own pannel that displayed
items in an array.
I also made a slider that modified an arbitrary value that was displayed in
the pannel.

Messed around with making lines using the map maker pannel.

Today I tried to change the makefile to be able to compile the map maker
across multiple files. I ran into an issue that I cant easily find the answer
for. The error says 'duplicate symbols' and I figured it was because my
header was not protected against double inclusion. So I fixed it, but that
didn't fix my problem. So I'll come back later and try something with the
help of my group mates.

I'll try to make some progress on the map's 'line' and 'thing' editor.
A few things need to be done with that:
	- Line pannel to choose flags, specials, textures
	- Thing pannel: angle
	- Sector pannel: heights
